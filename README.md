# newsltr
 A simple email newsletter engine for blogs.

 I did this project for learning purposes following Luca Palmieri's [Zero To Production In RUST](https://www.zero2prod.com).

# Project intent
 When configured on a blog, a blog visitor can subscribe to the newsletter to receive email updates on newly published content. 
 The blog author can notify the blog subscribers on new content.

# TODO
- unsubscribe;
- manage multiple newsletters;
- segment subscribers in multiple audiences;
- track opening and click rates.
